# Background

Plastic pollution exacerbates climate change, poses human health risks through the ingestion of microplastics and chemical exposure, and has significant environmental impacts on wildlife, animal habitats, and ecosystems. The OECD reports that, without significant change, greenhouse gas emissions associated with plastic products are expected to double by 2060, and the World Economic Forum projects that, unless there is some intervention, the global plastic industry will account for 20% of total oil consumption and up to 15% of global carbon emissions by 2050 (EPA, 2025). In the US, of the 40 to 48 million tons of plastic waste produced annually, it is estimated that only 5% to 9% is actually recycled (World Economic Forum, 2022). The vast majority of it is sent to landfills, incinerated, or worse, released into the environment.

Implementing AI-driven waste monitoring systems could reduce plastic pollution and increase the amount of plastic waste that is actually recycled. The AI monitoring systems would help effectively sort plastic waste with higher accuracy and speed, reducing contamination and increasing the quality of recycled materials. Consumers and households, state and local governments, waste management companies and recycling processors, AI and technology providers, and packaging and consumer goods manufacturers are the primary stakeholders in this issue. 

Consumers and households are the primary drivers of plastic waste, and their ability to sort and avoid contamination has a direct impact on recycling outcomes. Consumers seek convenience and confidence in existing systems, and they want to know that their personal waste is actually recycled once it reaches the processing facility. Challenges include unclear recycling rules and a lack of feedback on recycling efforts, leaving individuals unsure whether they are properly recycling. Public pressure from consumers can drive policy change and influence the implementation of new regulations or systems. 

State and local governments are responsible for designing, funding, and enforcing new policies directed towards recycling and waste management. They set mandates, provide incentives, and collect data, as governments require accurate, real-time information on waste streams to track progress and ensure compliance with laws. Governments may also face challenges in deploying AI systems on a large scale, primarily due to a lack of expertise and resources. They would need AI professionals to assist them in doing so. Their influence on this issue is substantial, as they are the deciding factor in whether AI monitoring becomes part of the public waste infrastructure. 

Waste management companies and recycling processors operate material recovery facilities (MRFs), where they haul and process recyclables. In Seattle, the waste management companies are Waste Management and Recology. Implementing these AI systems would reduce labor costs and contamination, while also increasing the resale value of collected materials. They have a significant influence on the issue, as they determine which materials are accepted and how efficiently the system operates. Their feedback is also crucial to the policy's feasibility. 
AI and technology providers develop and deploy tools utilizing image recognition and data analytics for waste monitoring.

Packaging and consumer-goods manufacturers design and produce packaging materials that enter the waste stream. They aim to avoid stricter packaging regulations by demonstrating compliance with sustainability and recycling goals. There is potential to utilize AI data to inform packaging redesign and ensure compliance with recycling regulations, particularly when plastics are used. However, they may resist these changes if they would result in increased costs to comply with the new regulations.
