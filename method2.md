title: Policy Options and Recommendations

Develop statewide AI implementation and funding programs. Establish a state grant or cost-sharing initiative to support AI deployment in material-recovery facilities (MRFs). The goal of this policy would be to accelerate and standardize the adoption of AI-driven waste monitoring, sorting, and reporting systems across municipal recycling facilities statewide. Creating the state-managed fund would provide grants to cities and waste facilities that implement AI tools, such as AMP Robotics, Recycleye, or Glacier, which all utilize AI vision to sort and organize waste. Prioritizing grants for underserved or smaller municipalities that cannot otherwise afford these upgrades would facilitate the successful implementation of this process nationwide. 

Requiring standardized performance metrics, such as contamination rates, recovery improvement, cost savings, and carbon emissions impact, would help track the policy's progress and success. This would produce consistent, real-time waste data to help environmental policy decisions and track the progress of recycling, helping to reduce the amount of unrecycled plastic waste in our environment.

Standardize waste data and reporting requirements. This policy will establish a consistent, statewide framework for collecting, categorizing, and reporting recycling and waste data, particularly AI-generated data. This would help policymakers track contamination, recycling rates, and the accurate flow of materials across different cities and facilities. Every city has its own method for measuring waste and recycling, making it challenging to track, compare, and aggregate this data. This makes it even more challenging to assess which programs or technologies, such as AI, are enhancing recycling outcomes. 

Developing a statewide data framework through an agency like the Department of Ecology would establish a standardized set of variables that all facilities must report, including total tons processed, contamination rate, recyclables recovered, AI-detected composition, and other relevant metrics. Recycling facilities will feed their digital data directly into a state-managed platform, automating data collection and reducing manual reporting errors by mandating integration with AI systems. This creates a centralized data portal with a publicly accessible online dashboard that shows performance by county of facility, enabling data-driven policymaking. Officials can identify where recycling systems fail and target interventions more efficiently. This encourages continuous improvement by benchmarking performance across facilities. 

Public-Private Partnership Program for AI in Recycling. This policy aims to foster collaboration among governments, tech firms, and recycling companies to scale AI efficiently. The state's Department of Ecology, or a similar entity, could establish a formal partnership program that brings together recycling technology firms, waste haulers, and municipalities for collaborative efforts. Participating companies would gain access to public funding, pilot sites, and data-sharing agreements as incentives, and municipalities would report participation and success. The pilots could evaluate metrics such as contamination reduction, improvement in recovery rates, energy efficiency, and cost savings. After successful pilot phases, partnerships would be scaled through long-term contracts or additional funding. 

Not only would this policy facilitate the recycling and proper disposal of plastic waste, but it would also encourage the rapid deployment of proven AI solutions across facilities, thereby eliminating the need for individual city action. Public access to the private-sector data improves policymaking and program evaluation. This policy change would also reduce local government spending by leveraging private infrastructure.   

Policy option one would be the smartest policy to implement. It directly addresses recycling and plastic waste, and the statewide funding makes it equitable and possible for all municipalities to implement it, creating a data foundation for progress tracking and future policy refinement. Options two and three are also beneficial policies, but would best complement option one and would not be as strong without policy one put into place first.
