title: Policy Options & Recommendations
permalink: /policy/
---

Based on the evidence from case studies and data analysis, this section presents three policy options for addressing plastic pollution through AI technology, with a recommendation for implementation.

---

## Option 1: Statewide AI Implementation and Funding Program ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

<div style="background: #e8f5e9; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #2c5f2d; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c5f2d;">Goal</h3>
  <p>Accelerate and standardize the adoption of AI-driven waste monitoring, sorting, and reporting systems across municipal recycling facilities statewide.</p>
</div>

### Implementation Strategy

**Establish a state grant or cost-sharing initiative** to support AI deployment in material recovery facilities (MRFs). This state-managed fund would provide grants to cities and waste facilities that implement AI tools such as:
- AMP Robotics
- Recycleye
- Glacier

**Key Features:**
- Prioritize grants for underserved or smaller municipalities
- Require standardized performance metrics:
  - Contamination rates
  - Recovery improvement
  - Cost savings
  - Carbon emissions impact
- Produce consistent, real-time waste data
- Track progress toward state recycling goals

### Why This Is The Best Option

✅ **Directly addresses** recycling and plastic waste  
✅ **Equitable access** - statewide funding makes it possible for all municipalities  
✅ **Data foundation** for progress tracking and future policy refinement  
✅ **Proven technology** with measurable results from case studies  
✅ **Scalable** approach that can expand as technology improves

## Option 2: Standardize Waste Data and Reporting Requirements

<div style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #1976d2; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #1976d2;">Goal</h3>
  <p>Establish a consistent, statewide framework for collecting, categorizing, and reporting recycling and waste data, particularly AI-generated data.</p>
</div>

### Implementation Strategy

**Develop a statewide data framework** through an agency like the Department of Ecology to establish standardized variables that all facilities must report:
- Total tons processed
- Contamination rate
- Recyclables recovered
- AI-detected composition
- Other relevant metrics

**Key Features:**
- Mandate integration with AI systems for automatic data collection
- Create centralized data portal with public dashboard
- Show performance by county or facility
- Enable data-driven policymaking
- Benchmark performance across facilities

### Benefits

- Identifies where recycling systems fail
- Enables targeted interventions
- Reduces manual reporting errors
- Encourages continuous improvement
- Provides transparency to public

**Note:** This policy would complement Option 1 but would not be as effective implemented alone.

## Option 3: Public-Private Partnership Program for AI in Recycling

<div style="background: #fff3e0; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #ef6c00; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #ef6c00;">Goal</h3>
  <p>Foster collaboration among governments, tech firms, and recycling companies to scale AI efficiently.</p>
</div>

### Implementation Strategy

**Establish a formal partnership program** through the Department of Ecology (or similar entity) bringing together:
- Recycling technology firms
- Waste haulers
- Municipalities

**Incentives for Participation:**
- Access to public funding
- Pilot sites for testing
- Data-sharing agreements

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Contamination reduction
- Recovery rate improvements
- Energy efficiency gains
- Cost savings

### Benefits

- Rapid deployment of proven AI solutions
- Eliminates need for individual city action
- Public access to private sector data
- Reduces local government spending
- Leverages private infrastructure

**Note:** This policy would also complement Option 1 but requires established funding and standards first.

    <li>Establish funding program</li>
    <li>Set performance standards</li>
    <li>Accept grant applications</li>
    <li>Fund initial pilot sites</li>
  </ul>
  
  <strong>Phase 2 (Year 2):</strong> Add Option 2
  <ul>
    <li>Launch standardized data framework</li>
    <li>Connect AI systems to central portal</li>
    <li>Begin public reporting</li>
  </ul>
  
  <strong>Phase 3 (Year 3+):</strong> Expand with Option 3
  <ul>
    <li>Formalize public-private partnerships</li>
    <li>Scale successful pilots statewide</li>
    <li>Continuous improvement based on data</li>
  </ul>
