## Centerville, Ohio: Camera-Based Contamination Reduction

<div style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #1976d2; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <strong>Challenge:</strong> High contamination rates in recycling bins<br>
  <strong>Solution:</strong> Camera-based technology to identify and flag non-recyclable items in real-time
</div>

Centerville launched a project to address recycling contamination using camera-based technology. The cameras identify and flag items that do not meet local recycling guidelines in real-time, allowing for intervention and proper disposal. After items are addressed, the city contacts residents with notecards offering tips and tricks on recycling to help mitigate recurring issues.

**Results:**
- Reduced contamination rates
- Improved efficiency in waste management systems
- Lower production costs
- Better resident education on proper recycling

City Manager Wayne Davis claims this new process will lower production costs and improve the overall efficiency of the waste organization and collection.

## San Francisco: Oscar Sort AI Assistant

<div style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #1976d2; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <strong>Challenge:</strong> High contamination rates in public recycling and compost bins<br>
  <strong>Solution:</strong> Oscar Sort - an interactive AI recycling assistant
</div>

San Francisco faced high contamination rates in recycling and compost bins in public spaces, along with difficulty engaging residents and visitors in proper waste sorting. To combat this, they launched three installations of Oscar Sort at the city's Ferry Building and Exploratorium.

The technology identifies the item the user is discarding and directs them to the appropriate bin: compost, recycling, or landfill.

**Results:**
- Improved waste sorting accuracy
- Reduced recycling contamination
- Increased public awareness and participation
- Contributed toward the city's "Zero Waste by 2030" initiative

This demonstrates how large urban areas can leverage AI as both an education and operational sustainability tool, showing the value of integrating interactive, user-facing technology into waste management policy.

## AMP Robotics: Industrial-Scale AI Sorting

<div style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #1976d2; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <strong>Challenge:</strong> High labor costs, inefficiency in traditional facilities, difficulty sorting mixed waste streams<br>
  <strong>Solution:</strong> AI platform with cameras and robotic sorting arms
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chendry6-blip/SOC401Website/main/assets/plastic-ai.jpg" alt="AMP Robotics AI Technology" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
</div>

AMP Robotics developed an AI platform that utilizes cameras to scan mixed waste streams and identify materials based on visual cues such as shape and color, enabling physical sorting and placement on corresponding conveyor belts.

**Impressive Performance Metrics:**
- Recognizes over **100 material categories**
- Operates at **80 items per minute**
- Achieves up to **99% accuracy**
- Reduces reliance on manual labor
- Increases data collection efficiency

AMP Robotics' innovation demonstrates how private and public sectors can collaborate to efficiently address recycling issues and shows the potential of AI automation to scale efficiency improvements nationwide.

  <h3 style="color: #2c5f2d; margin-top: 0;">Key Takeaways</h3>
  <p>These case studies demonstrate that AI technology is already proving effective at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reducing contamination in recycling streams</li>
    <li>Increasing sorting accuracy and speed</li>
    <li>Educating the public on proper waste disposal</li>
    <li>Lowering operational costs for municipalities</li>
    <li>Providing real-time data for policy decisions</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>However, these efforts remain fragmented and localized. Statewide policy is needed to scale these successes.</strong></p>
