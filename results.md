The examples in the case study demonstrate that efforts are moving the United States in the right direction, with reports of improved costs, increased recycling sorting, and enhanced efficiency. However, they are fragmented and have a limited impact, primarily benefiting local communities as they occur in select cities through private contracts or pilot projects. Without state guidance or funding, smaller municipalities cannot afford to implement AI systems or lack the necessary expertise to do so. Having city-based efforts rather than state-level policies also prevents the government from accurately measuring and tracking recycling performance, contamination, or plastic waste generation.
