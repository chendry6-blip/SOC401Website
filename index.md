# Executive Summary

  Plastic pollution is one of the world's leading contributors to climate change and is a severe problem that needs to be addressed. AI technology is rapidly evolving and is used in many aspects of our lives, from assisting with everyday tasks to influencing policy changes. How can AI-driven waste monitoring help governments identify operational and systematic inefficiencies in recycling systems and design more effective packaging and waste-reduction policies? Developing a statewide implementation of AI tools with vision sorting would be the most effective and impactful way to address this issue.
