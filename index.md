# Executive Summary

  Plastic pollution is one of the world's leading contributors to climate change and is a severe problem that needs to be addressed. AI technology is rapidly evolving and is used in many aspects of our lives, from assisting with everyday tasks to influencing policy changes. How can AI-driven waste monitoring help governments identify operational and systematic inefficiencies in recycling systems and design more effective packaging and waste-reduction policies? Developing a statewide implementation of AI tools with vision sorting would be the most effective and impactful way to address this issue. 
  

# Case Studies
  To understand how AI is currently being applied to recycling and waste management, this case study examines recent initiatives in Centerville, Ohio, and San Francisco, California, as well as companies and groups such as AMP Robotics. Investigating these examples reveals that local governments and private companies are taking steps toward addressing this issue with the help of AI, providing insight into the potential benefits and limitations of implementing statewide AI policy.
  
  Centerville, Ohio, has been experiencing contamination in its recycling bins, and the city has been working to find a solution for this issue. To achieve this, they launched a project to address and reduce recycling contamination using camera-based technology. The cameras identify and flag items that do not meet local recycling guidelines in real-time, allowing for intervention and proper disposal (Edinger, 2025). After the items are addressed, the city contacts residents with notecards offering tips and tricks on recycling to help mitigate recurring issues. The City Manager, Wayne Davis, claims this new process will lower production costs and improve the overall efficiency of the waste organization and collection (City of Centerville, 2025). As a result, Centerville is now experiencing reduced contamination and improved efficiency in its waste management systems.
  
  San Francisco is facing a similar challenge of high contamination rates in recycling and compost bins in public spaces. They also faced difficulty engaging residents and visitors in proper waste sorting. To combat this, they launched three installations of Oscar Sort, a zero-waste AI recycling assistant, at the city's Ferry Building and Exploratorium. The technology identifies the item the user is discarding and directs them to the appropriate bin: compost, recycling, or landfill, and then directs the user accordingly (Edinger, 2025). San Francisco has found that Oscar Sort has improved waste sorting accuracy, reduced recycling contamination, increased public awareness and participation in sustainable disposal habits, and contributed toward the city's "Zero Waste by 2030" initiative. This demonstrates how large urban areas can leverage AI as both an education and operational sustainability tool. It shows the value of integrating interactive, user-facing technology into waste management policy.
  
  AMP Robotics, a technology company that utilizes artificial intelligence and robotics for waste management, was facing challenges including high labor costs, inefficiency in traditional recycling facilities, and difficulty accurately sorting mixed waste streams at scale. To address this issue, they developed an AI platform that utilizes cameras to scan mixed waste streams and identify materials based on visual cues such as shape and color, enabling physical sorting and placement on the corresponding conveyor belts (AMP, 2022). AMP reported success with their system, recognizing over 100 material categories, operating at a rate of around 80 items per minute with an accuracy of up to 99 percent (AMP, 2022). This has reduced their reliance on manual labor while increasing data collection efficiency and capabilities. AMP Robotics' innovation demonstrates how private and public sectors can collaborate to efficiently address recycling issues and the potential of AI automation to scale efficiency improvements nationwide.
