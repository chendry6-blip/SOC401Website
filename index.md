  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

  <p>Plastic pollution is one of the world's leading contributors to climate change and is a severe problem that needs to be addressed. AI technology is rapidly evolving and is used in many aspects of our lives, from assisting with everyday tasks to influencing policy changes.</p>

  <p><strong>How can AI-driven waste monitoring help governments identify operational and systematic inefficiencies in recycling systems and design more effective packaging and waste-reduction policies?</strong></p>

  <p>Developing a statewide implementation of AI tools with vision sorting would be the most effective and impactful way to address this issue.</p>

  <h2>The Crisis: Why We Need Change Now</h2>

  <p>Plastic pollution exacerbates climate change, poses human health risks through the ingestion of microplastics and chemical exposure, and has significant environmental impacts on wildlife, animal habitats, and ecosystems.</p>

  <p>The OECD reports that, without significant change, <strong>greenhouse gas emissions associated with plastic products are expected to double by 2060</strong>. The World Economic Forum projects that, unless there is intervention, the global plastic industry will account for <strong>20% of total oil consumption and up to 15% of global carbon emissions by 2050</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Current State of Recycling in America</h3>

  <p>In the US, of the <strong>40 to 48 million tons of plastic waste</strong> produced annually, it is estimated that only <strong>5% to 9% is actually recycled</strong>. The vast majority of it is sent to landfills, incinerated, or worse—released into the environment.</p>
